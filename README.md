## SONYC - NY  -(topic: smartcities)    
    http://wp.nyu.edu/sonyc
    http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl/research/sonyc

 objective is to  create technological solutions for:
  1) The systematic, constant monitoring of noise pollution at city scale.
  2) The accurate description of acoustic environments in terms of its composing sources.
  3) Broadening citizen participation in noise reporting and mitigation.
  4) Enabling city agencies to take effective, information-driven action for noise mitigation.
